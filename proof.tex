\section*{Proof of correctness an n-bit adder}
\today

\subsection*{Proof}

Suppose that the QUBO cost function $C_k(x,y,s)$ provides solutions for
$x+y=s$ when $x$ and $y$ are $n-1$-bit integers and $s$ is a $n$-bit
integer.
Denote $x_n, \ldots, x_1$ the bits of $x$ in order from MSB to LSB, and
similarly for $y$ ($y_n, \ldots, y_1$) and $s$ ($s_{n+1}, \ldots, s_1$).
Furthermore, suppose that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] The maximum magnitude weights for these
cost functions have values of $+/- 4^{k-1}$
\item[(2)] The weights satisfy: the weights on/connection between
$x_i$, $y_j$, and $s_k$ are exactly 4 times those on/between
$x_{i-1}$, $y_{j-1}$, and $s_{k-1}$
respectively (for all $i,j,k > 1$).
\end{enumerate}
Then any function $C_n(x,y,s)$ that contains all the terms from
$C_{n-1}$ will necessarilly provide correct energies for solving $x+y=s$,
whenever $x_n = 0$ and $y_n = 0$.
Similarly, consider any scaling of the $n$-bit adder weights applied
to the $n-1$ MSB of $x_n$ and $y_n$. 
Specifically, choose these weight so that they are 4 times those of the
standard $n-1$-bit adder.
Then whenever $x_1=0$ and $y_1=0$, the function $C_n(x,y,s)$ with these
weights will satisfy all the constraints to guarantee $x+y=s$.
Furthermore, by (2), these weights do not conflict with the previously
assigned weights, and by construction, property (2) is maintained.
Also, this establishes a lower bound for (1) since weights of
$+/- 4^n$ will be assigned.

So, it remains to choose:
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 connections between $x_n \& x_1$, $x_n \& y_1$, $y_n \& x_1$,
and $y_n \& y_1$. ($=2^n$)
\item 2 connections between $s_{n+1} \& x_1$ and $s_{n+1} \& y_1$.
($=-2^{n+1}$)
\item 2 connections between $s_1 \& x_n$ and $s_1 \& y_n$.
($=-2^n$)
\item 1 connection between $s_1 \& s_{n+1}$. ($=2^{n+1}$)
\end{itemize}

There are $3\times 3 \times (2^{(2n-2)}) \times 2^{n+1}$ inequality
constraints that have not yet been addressed.
(3 ways the 2 MSBs could be nonzero, 3 ways the 2 LSBs could be nonzero,
$(2^{(2n-4)})$ combinations of the 2 sets of $n-2$ bits that are neither
the MSB or LSB of $x$ or $y$, and $2^{n+1}$ ways to choose $s$).

\begin{align*}    
C_n(x,y,z) = \sum_{i=1}^n{4^i(x_i+y_i)}
+ \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}{4^is_i} 
+ \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n}2^{i+j-1}(x_ix_j+y_iy_j) 
+ \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n+1}2^{i+j-1}s_is_j\\
+ \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n2^{i+j-1}x_iy_j 
- \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\sum_{i=1}^n2^{i+j-1}s_i(x_j+y_j)
\end{align*}
