Experimental Results

# Setup

- Make pinning use $2^n$ as the weight for whatever number of bits
- Make chain strength set to $2^n$ as well
- Embed QUBO before sending, so we can see what it looks like


# Addition and Multiplication

- 2-bit up to 10-bit numbers
- linearly increase number of samples as $100 n$
- try all pinned inputs for 2 and 3 bit addition, check for rate of success by input
- Pick random biprimes and factor for multiplication
- Write circuit for solving a number squared

# Least Squares Demo

  $$\begin{align}
  xy &= \alpha \\
  x^2 + y^2 &= \beta \\
  ax + by &= \gamma
  \end{align}$$
